A URL shortener is a service that helps take longer URLs (which can be more than a hundred characters) and transform/convert them into manageable or short links that rarely pass 20 characters. In this project [URL Shortener Website], there is only an input field on the website to enter or paste a long URL and a button to shorten the long URL. This input field has full validation that means the user can only type or enter a URL to shorten it.
